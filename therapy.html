		<center><h1>5 Pieces of Life Advice from Psychologists and Therapists</h1></center>
	
		<p><b><h1>1) "Dont take your thoughts so seriously."</h1></b></p><br>
		<p>I know from personal experience that our thoughts can make us go pretty crazy sometimesbut the thing is, they're just thoughts. And we really shouldnt take them so seriously. "This one piece of advice can help every single person across all psychological disorders, as well as just regular everyday life problems" says clinical psychologist Anna Prudovski, M.A. "Thoughts are not facts. And they are not threats. They are, well, just thoughts. If we learn to take a step back and observe them instead of either engaging with them or fighting them, our lives will immediately improve. And even if your thought is 100% true, ask yourself if engaging with it helps you, or does it bring more problems and misery?"

		<b><h1>2)"Practice self-care."</h1></b><br>
		A more professional rendition of the everpopular: treat yourself. "Across the board, the one thing that seems to make the most difference is self-care," says Marriage and Family Therapist Jenn Kennedy. When people attend to their own needs, it has benefits that push back on a litany of challenges. Examples of selfcare: massage, time with friends, take a class, yoga class, take a nap. Whatever makes you feel better and feels kind to you is helpful for pushing back on the usual mental health culprits."

		<b><h1>3)"Take your own advice"</h1></b><br>
                We are experts when it comes to comforting and advising our friends, but totally freeze up when it comes to helping ourselves through a tough time. Therefore, we should channel advice we'd give a friend in the same situation. This is further explained by Paul DePompo, boardcertified psychologist: "We are way better at coming to solutions when it is for someone we care about. When it comes to us it can get so stressful that we cannot think as clear, so the best advice is what would you say to a friend?"

		<br><br>
                <b><h1>4)"Practice being self-compassionate."</h1></b><br>
		We dedicate a lot of time and energy into being there for our loved ones, but we dont give ourselves that same necessary attention. Its time we start showing ourselves some compassion, according to Julianne Schroeder, certified therapist. "You wonâ€™t experience a transformation overnight, but being committed to thinking, feeling, and doing things differently will allow for a different result," she explains. "Learning to counter negative selftalk is a requirement for becoming more accepting and compassionate of oneself. Trust the process, taking it one compassionate statement or action at a time.

		<b><h1>5)"Do your best to remain a willing, accepting, and teachable person."</h1></b><br>
		We are all striving to be the best people we can be. To some, thats being kind, patient, hardworking, determined, funny, fit, and goodlooking all at the same time. But how exhausting and unrealistic is that? Its time we narrow that list and seek to become a willing, accepting, and teachable individual instead, according to Licensed Clinical Psychologist Natalie Feinblatt. "You wont be perfect at it, but should focus on progress rather than perfection," she says. "These three mindsets will serve you greatly in regard to your mental health, relationships, and overall wellness."
