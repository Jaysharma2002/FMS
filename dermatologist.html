        <div class="tip">
            <h2>1. Use Sunscreen Daily</h2>
            <p>UV rays can cause premature aging, wrinkles, and increase the risk of skin cancer. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day, even on cloudy days, to protect your skin from harmful sun exposure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>2. Moisturize Regularly</h2>
            <p>Keeping your skin hydrated is essential to prevent dryness, flakiness, and irritation. Choose a moisturizer suitable for your skin type (oily, dry, combination) and apply it daily, especially after washing your face or showering.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>3. Avoid Over-Exfoliating</h2>
            <p>While exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, over-exfoliating can irritate and damage the skin barrier, leading to dryness and sensitivity. Limit exfoliation to 1-2 times a week, using gentle products, particularly if you have sensitive skin.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>4. Maintain a Healthy Diet</h2>
            <p>What you eat impacts your skin. Dermatologists recommend a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats (like omega-3s) to promote glowing skin. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods, as they can contribute to acne and inflammation.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>5. Don't Pick at Your Skin</h2>
            <p>Picking at acne, blemishes, or scabs can lead to scarring, infection, and worsen the problem. It's best to resist the urge and consult a dermatologist for professional treatment options if you experience persistent issues.</p>
