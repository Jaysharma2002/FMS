        <h1> Vegan Salad</h1>
<p>
RECIPE FEATURES<br>
Summer fruit: This fruit salad features pineapple, kiwi, strawberries, and blueberries. I recommend using fresh fruit but this salad can also be made using canned fruit.<br>
Flavors: The lightly sweet and zesty dressing emphasizes the naturally sweet flavor of fresh summer fruit.<br>
Dairy and egg-free: Many traditional fruit salads use sour cream or even mayonnaise, but this vegan coconut dressing uses coconut cream instead for a light and creamy dressing.<br>
Great for gatherings: This fruit salad is the perfect addition to BBQs, picnics, and get togethers.<br>
When making a fruit salad the key is to have a variety of colors and shapes. Think of your fruit salad as a rainbow!

My go-to fruits for fruit salad are strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, and blueberries. Slice the strawberries into quarters and the kiwis into wedges. Slice pineapple into chunks.

Other fruit options:
<br><br>
Melons like watermelon or canteloupe
Grapes
Sliced green apple
Sliced banana
Raspberries and blackberries are best if the salad is being served immediately

Combine everything together, and enjoy!<br><br>
