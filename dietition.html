        <div class="tip">
            <h2>1. Eat a Balanced Diet</h2>
            <p>Include a variety of foods from all food groups: fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. A well-balanced diet provides essential nutrients your body needs to function optimally.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>2. Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <p>Drinking enough water is crucial for digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall health. Aim for at least 8 glasses (2 liters) of water a day, but adjust based on your activity level and climate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>3. Control Portion Sizes</h2>
            <p>Overeating, even healthy foods, can lead to weight gain and digestive issues. Practice mindful eating by listening to your bodyâ€™s hunger cues and managing portion sizes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>4. Limit Processed Foods</h2>
            <p>Highly processed foods often contain excess sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Opt for whole, minimally processed foods whenever possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>5. Plan Meals Ahead</h2>
            <p>Meal planning can help you make healthier choices, save time, and avoid impulsive eating. Preparing meals in advance also makes it easier to control portion sizes and meet your nutritional goals.</p>
