<h1><font size="10">Benefits of Yoga</font></h1>
<center>Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. And, if you're going through an illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part of your treatment and potentially hasten healing.<br>

A yoga therapist can work with patients and put together individualized plans that work together with their medical and surgical therapies. That way, yoga can support the healing process and help the person experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress<br>.</center>

 <font size="7">1.Yoga Squat Pose (Malasana)</font>: Strengthens the Lower Back
If you’ve ever been to East Asia, you may recognize what's known as the "Asian squat". Yoga also incorporates this pose which has loads of health benefits. You can enter malasana by standing with feet parallel, slightly wider than the hips. Then bend knees and slowly lower down the pelvis until the hips go lower than the knees. Keep the back straight and take arms in front in a prayer position. The malasana pose helps stretch the groin and lower back, tones the belly, and also releases tension in the hips and knees.

<center><h1>5 Skincare Tips Dermatologists and Estheticians Know (That You Don't)</h1></center>
<img src="b.webp" width="500" height="350" >
<h2>Tip #1: Avoid the Sun and Wear Sunscreen</h2>
"Avoid the sun, and when you cant avoid it, wear sunscreen and a hat. I swear by Coolibar sunprotective clothing and Colorescience's Sunforgettable Total Protection BrushOn Shield SPF 50."
<br><br>
<h2>Tip #2: Get a Full-Body Exam</h2>
"You have to get a fullbody skin exam by a dermatologist by the time you turn 30. Its important to have expert eyes take a look at any moles you may have and be able to follow them for changes in the future. Also, the dermatologist can teach you how to do a proper skin check on yourself. This is very important because melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, is almost 100% curable if caught in its earliest stages. If women are armed with information on what to look for, it may save their lives"
<br><br>
<h2>Tip #3: Stimulate Blood Flow</h2>
"Ginseng applied topically is one of my favorite skincare tipsit works to stimulate blood flow in the capillaries, promoting a healthy, firmed, glowing-from-within visage. Bonus points if you layer a product containing plumping hyaluronic acid with your ginseng!".
<br><br>
<h2>#4: Invest in a Great Moisturizer</h2>
"Moisturizers help our skin barrier by providing lipids, protecting from external chemicals, and providing water to our sometimes parched skin. My all-time favorite moisturizer is, of course, virgin coconut oil."
<br><br>
<h2>Tip #5: Aim for a Restful Night's Sleep</h2>
"I often explain this concept to patients by giving the analogy of our minds being like a computer that needs to be rebooted every night so as to process everything we put into them. Seven to eight hours of sleep allows this to happen."<br><br>
