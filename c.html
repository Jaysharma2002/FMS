<label>BBQ CAULIFLOWER BITES BOWL</label><br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
 

BBQ Cauliflower Bites:<br><br>
1 head cauliflower , chopped into bite sized pieces (gives about 4 cups)<br><br>
1 cup BBQ sauce (homemade one linked here, or use store bought to make it super easy)<br><br>

<br><br>Tangy Avocado Slaw:<br><br>
Ÿ - 1 cup avocado , about 1 average sized avocado<br><br>
4 cups shredded cabbage , can use a mix of red and green or a prepackaged mix too<br><br>
1 tablespoon lime juice<br><br>
œ teaspoon sea salt<br><br>

<br><br>Cilantro Lime Quinoa:<br><br>
Ÿ cup water , could also use broth if you prefer (see note)<br><br>
œ cup uncooked quinoa (see note)<br><br>
Œ cup chopped cilantro , divided (can use more if you love cilantro)<br><br>
Œ teaspoon sea salt<br><br>
1 tablespoon lime juice<br><br>


<br><br>INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
 
Preheat oven to 450 F/ 230 C
If youre making quinoa, mix the quinoa, water, 2 tablespoons of the chopped cilantro and salt in a small pot.
Place on stove top on high heat and bring to a boil (about 5-7 minutes).
Once boiling, cover, turn down the heat and cook an additional 12-15 minutes until the water is absorbed. 
Once done remove from heat and let sit until youre done with everything else. If using ready rice, follow the instructions in the notes.
Meanwhile, mix the chopped cauliflower with the BBQ sauce in a bowl.
Spread on a parchment lined cookie sheet.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until brown and sticky. Bake less if you like your cauliflower al dente, and more if you like it more cooked.
While it is baking, mix all slaw ingredients together to make tangy avocado slaw.
Dont forget to watch the quinoa as the cauliflower is baking as well.
When the cauliflower is done, fluff the quinoa with a fork, and add the other 2 tablespoons of cilantro and the lime juice. Mix well.

Separate everything into 4 bowls, drizzle with extra BBQ sauce if you prefer and devour!<br><br>
