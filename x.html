			<p>	<h1> Healthy Paratha</h1><br><br>		
Parathas are one of the most popular unleavened flat breads from North India. Usually made with whole wheat flour and stuffed with different vegetables, these are enjoyed with butter and pickle.
<br>
The oats paratha I am sharing today is not a stuffed one. We add all the ingredients, form a dough and make the paratha. So much more easier than making the stuffed kind.
<br>
Oats are incredibly nutritious and are a good source of fiber, low in carbs and aids in weight loss. It is a wonderful grain to include in our diet.

INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
STEP BY STEP  INSTRUCTIONS:
<ol>
	<li> Add the oats to a blender and make fine powder.</li><br>

	<li> Transfer the powdered oats in to a large bowl and add the whole wheat flour, veggies, spices, salt and oil.</li><br>

	<li> Mix it well and add just enough water to make a dough.</li><br>

	<li> Make a dough which is soft and smooth but not sticky. Cover it and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.</li><br>

	<li>After the dough is rested, divide it in to 5 to 6 equal sized balls.</li><br>
			<li>Add some wheat flour to the board and flatten the dough and roll in to a circle. Add some flour while rolling to avoid sticking.</li><br>

			<li> Heat a pan and place the rolled paratha into the tawa and cook for two minutes. When the paratha is partially cooked, flip to the other side and add some oil.</li><br>

			<li> Flip again and add little oil on the second side and press the paratha with a spatula for even cooking. When you see golden spots on both sides, paratha is done. Remove and keep them warm till you are ready to serve.
			</li><br>
			</ol>
			<br>Repeat the same process and make rest of the paratha.
