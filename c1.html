        <h1> Russian Salad</h1>
<p>How to make Russian Salad <br><br>Preparing the vegetables<br><br>
1. First, rinse 1 medium-sized carrot, 1 medium to large potato, 7 to 8 french beans (¼ cup chopped) and ½ cup green peas in fresh water.
Other veggies you can include are cauliflower, snow peas, edamame beans, sweet corn, baby corn, cabbage, broccoli.<br><br>

Note that all vegetable have different cooking times. So keep this fact in mind if you are boiling the vegetables. Add the vegetables that take less time to cook later.
For cooking in the pan: Peel and chop the vegetables. Add them to a pot or pan with water almost covering them. Cover and simmer on medium-low to medium heat until the vegetables are fork-tender.
<br><br>
For cooking in Instant Pot: Add 1.5 cups to 2 cups water in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Place a trivet inside the water. Keep a pan filled with peeled and chopped vegetables on the trivet. Seal the lid moving the valve to sealing position. Pressure cook on high for 10 to 15 minutes until veggies are fork tender. Carefully give a quick pressure release after 5 minutes.
For cooking in a pressure cooker: Either add whole vegetables to boil or steam them in a pan inside the cooker. When I use a stovetop pressure cooker, I add whole vegetables and boil them. Add enough water covering the veggies.
<br><br>
Pressure cook for 2 to 3 whistles on medium to medium-high heat. If the potato is too large, halve or quarter it. When the pressure drops on its own in the pressure cooker then only open the lid.
<br><br>
According to your preferences you can steam or boil the vegetables. I usually prefer to steam or boil the veggies whole as water-soluble vitamins and minerals are lost when vegetables aren’t cooked whole.
<br><br>
Choose any method that suits you. After the vegetables are cooked and are just fork-tender, drain all the water.
<br>
Set aside till they become warm. Then peel and chop the potatoes and carrots in cubes. Chop the french beans. Set aside the cooked and chopped vegetables.
<br>
<p>
Combine everything together, and enjoy!<br><br>
